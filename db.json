      "body": "“I love playing around with body movements and using bits of equipment to help add assistance or resistance. As a swimmer, my body movement can feel different on land compared to the pool. Finding ways to challenge my body and support my posture has been a huge passion for me. Whilst technically it’s not I can still work on improving technique, it’s about listening to my body and working with how it feels on that day. Here are some of the posture exercises for swimmers from today.",

      "body": "In actual fact there is nothing easier than swimming on your back and the most popular warm-down exercise is the double arm backstroke: rotating both your arms backwards at the same time with a breaststroke leg kick.It is true that we cannot control our hand movements during the power phase, because they are out of our visual field but, seeing as the mouth is always out of the water, we can breathe however we like.",

      "body": "Swimming is only ranked 44th in terms of difficulty in the ESPN (a US TV channel that broadcasts sports programs only) world rankings. A study of the parameters on which these rankings are based (coordination, stamina, flexibility, strength, endurance, speed, agility and analytical attitude) shows that swimming is second only to gymnastics in terms of coordination. Coordination means implementing a motor scheme that your brain has just designed.",

      "body": "After all, a primitive form of breaststroke was the very first movement performed by a human being to move forward through the water. This suggests it might be simple but it is not. The fact that it comes naturally does not mean that doing it the right way is by any means easy technically speaking.It takes an incredible amount of energy to swim the breaststroke (approximately 500 kcal/h for women and 700 kcal/h for men), so it is extremely important to perfect your technique to make your swim stroke as economical as possible.",
